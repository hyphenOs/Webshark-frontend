# Packet Trail React Component

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/hyphenOs/pkt-trail-react.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/hyphenOs/pkt-trail-react)

Generally, it is not expected to be used 'stand-alone'. This component can be used with [Demo Application](https://github.com/hyphenOs/pkt-trail-react-demo-app).

**Note: This component is still early in development!**. If you face any problems, please create an issue!

Written in React.js, it receives and renders JSON Data from the backend server. It uses *Start* and *Stop* buttons to start or stop the data reception. Data communication is done using websocket protocol.

`yarn build` builds the app for production in `build` folder
